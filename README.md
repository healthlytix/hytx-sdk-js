You can find a getting started guide at:

https://developer.healthlytix.com

### In Node.js

In a JavaScript file:

```javascript
// import entire SDK
const HealthLytix = require('hytx-sdk-js');
```

### Example

```javascript
// all methods return either a promise or callback if async
// therefore we can use the new await to make the code cleaner

const HealthLytix = require('hytx-sdk-js');
const hytx = new HealthLytix('ApiID', 'ApiSecret');

(async function() {
    try {
        const hello = await hytx.ping();

        // upload a file
        // inputFile is the location of the file to upload
        // inputContent is the content-type of the file
        const inputFile = "your-file-path";
        const inputContent = "file-content-type";
        const requestId = await hytx.uploadFile(inputFile, inputContent);

        // run one of our apps... Alzheimers PHS
        // report will have the results
        const subjectAge = 70;
        const report = await hytx.runAlzheimersPHS(requestId, subjectAge)

        // check if report returned
        // check out https://developer.healthlytix.com/#alzheimers-phs
        // for details on the report Object structure
        if (report.requestId)
            console.log("Yay! ran the app!");

        const oldReport = await hytx.getAlzheimersPHS(requestId);
        if (oldReport.requestId)
            console.log("Ohh yeah! got that report!");

    } catch (e) {
        console.error(e);
    }
})();
```
